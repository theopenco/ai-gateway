We’ve revamped our [**self-hosting docs**](https://docs.llmgateway.io/self-host) to make it easier than ever to run LLM Gateway on your own terms.

## 🧱 Simplified Setup

- **Step-by-step instructions** – From Docker to domain setup
- **Zero-config local testing** – Try everything on your machine first
- **Production checklist** – Cover all security and scaling essentials

## 🛠️ Enterprise Ready

Ideal for orgs with compliance or latency needs:

- **Custom model integrations** – Add your private endpoints
- **API key proxying** – Route and monitor team usage easily
- **Audit logs & role controls** – Full control over access

Whether you're scaling to thousands of requests or just want local control – LLM Gateway now makes it easier to go self-hosted.
