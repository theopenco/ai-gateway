## ðŸŽ¯ Proper Project & Organization Context

The dashboard now properly reflects the database relationships between organizations, projects, API keys, and provider keys:

### Hierarchical Navigation

- **Organization switcher** in the sidebar header for easy organization switching
- **Project switcher** in the top bar for seamless project navigation
- **Context awareness** - all components now know which project/organization is selected

### Scoped Resource Management

- **API Keys** are now properly scoped to the selected project
- **Provider Keys** are scoped to the selected organization
- **Activity & Usage data** filtered by the selected project
- **Settings** contextualized to the appropriate scope (project vs organization)

## ðŸ“Š Enhanced Data Filtering

### Real-time Context Updates

All dashboard components now respond to project/organization changes:

- **Activity charts** automatically filter by selected project
- **Usage analytics** show project-specific metrics
- **Recent logs** display only logs from the current project
- **Cost breakdowns** reflect the selected project's usage

### Smart State Management

- **Dashboard context** provides centralized state management
- **Automatic cache invalidation** when switching contexts
- **Conditional rendering** based on selection state
- **Clear user feedback** showing current project/organization names

## ðŸŽ¨ Improved Log Display

### Better Text Handling

Fixed layout issues with long prompts and responses:

- **Proper text wrapping** for long AI responses and prompts
- **No more horizontal overflow** - content stays within screen bounds
- **Preserved formatting** in code blocks while allowing text to wrap
- **Full prompt visibility** - no truncation of important content

### Enhanced Layout

- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Proper flex layouts** that handle content overflow gracefully
- **Better spacing** between elements for improved readability

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Component Architecture

- **Centralized dashboard context** using React Context API
- **Proper prop drilling elimination** through context providers
- **TypeScript improvements** with consolidated type definitions
- **Performance optimizations** with memoized context values

### API Integration

- **Consistent filtering** across all API endpoints
- **Proper cache management** with React Query
- **Error handling** for missing context scenarios
- **Optimistic updates** for better user experience

These improvements make the dashboard more intuitive and align the UI with the underlying database architecture, providing a clearer understanding of how your projects, API keys, and provider keys relate to each other.
