## 🌐 Organizations & Projects

Manage everything with dedicated contexts:

- **Organization switcher** in the sidebar
- **Project switcher** in the top bar
- **API keys** belong to projects
- **Provider keys** belong to organizations
- **Usage, activity and settings** reflect the chosen context

## 📊 Focused Statistics

Charts, logs and cost breakdowns automatically update when you switch projects, keeping your data relevant.

## 📝 Cleaner Log Display

Long prompts and responses wrap correctly and the layout adapts to all screen sizes.

This update makes it easier to separate concerns between organizations and projects while keeping controls and statistics in sync.
