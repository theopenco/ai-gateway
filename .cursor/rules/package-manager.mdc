# Package Manager Rule

## Use pnpm Only

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Do not use npm or yarn.

### Commands to use:
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm add <package>` - Add a new dependency
- `pnpm add -D <package>` - Add a dev dependency
- `pnpm remove <package>` - Remove a dependency
- `pnpm run <script>` - Run package scripts
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the project

### Never use:
- ❌ `npm install`
- ❌ `npm add`
- ❌ `yarn install`
- ❌ `yarn add`

### Project structure:
This is a monorepo with workspaces managed by pnpm. The [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml) file defines the workspace configuration.

Key workspace directories:
- `apps/ui` - Frontend application
- `apps/gateway` - Backend gateway service
- `packages/models` - Shared models package

Always use `pnpm` commands when working with dependencies or running scripts in any part of the monorepo.
